This is a Feed Back App which collects the feedback from students and teachers.
This application is created using Java (Springboot App), MongoDB as an database.
Currently this project is made as an REST API which does the following functions:
    1.POST method which will collect the feedback and post stores it in the database.
    2.GET method which will fetch the feedback from the database.
we have tested this using the Postman and here is the result of this:
